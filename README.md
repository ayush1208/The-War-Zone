# The War Zone ðŸŽ®

**The War Zone** is a two-player fighting game and also the **first working project I ever built in 2018**.  
It features two unique modes â€” **Tank Battle** and **Airplane vs Soldier** â€” each designed to offer fun, fast-paced, and strategic gameplay.  
Comes with Background Music from Game of Thrones :)

## ðŸŽ® Game Modes  

1. **Tank Battle**  
   - Two tanks face off on opposite sides of a wall.  
   - Players fire cannonballs to damage and destroy the opponent.  
   - The wall introduces a strategic element, acting as both cover and obstacle.  

2. **Airplane vs Soldier**  
   - Asymmetrical gameplay with one player controlling an airplane in the sky and the other as a soldier on the ground.  
   - The airplane drops cannonballs, while the soldier must dodge and survive.  
   - The airplane is limited to a fixed number of shots, creating balance and tension.
