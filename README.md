# The War Zone 🎮

The War Zone is a two-player fighting game and also the first working project I ever built in 2018. 

⸻

🎮 Game Modes

1. Tank Battle
	•	Two tanks face off on opposite sides of a wall.
	•	Players fire cannonballs to damage and destroy the opponent.
	•	The wall introduces a strategic element, acting as both cover and obstacle.

2. Airplane vs Soldier
	•	Asymmetrical gameplay with one player controlling an airplane in the sky and the other as a soldier on the ground.
	•	The airplane drops cannonballs, while the soldier must dodge and survive.
	•	The airplane is limited to a fixed number of shots, creating balance and tension.

Also comes with Background Music from Game of Thrones
