ðŸŽ® Game Modes

1. Tank Battle

In this mode, two tanks face off on opposite sides of a wall.
	â€¢	Each player controls a tank and fires cannonballs to damage the opponent.
	â€¢	The wall acts as both a shield and an obstacle, adding a strategic element to the fight.
	â€¢	Precision, timing, and smart positioning are key to winning this mode.

2. Airplane vs Soldier

The second mode introduces asymmetrical gameplay:
	â€¢	One player controls an airplane flying overhead.
	â€¢	The other plays as a soldier on the ground.
	â€¢	The airplane drops cannonballs while the soldier must dodge and survive.
	â€¢	To keep the challenge balanced, the airplane has a limited number of shots, making every move count.

With Background Music.
